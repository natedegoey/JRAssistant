Playing around with iOS development. Created this simple app that can be used while playing the classic family card game, Jok-R-ummy. For my entire life my family and I have played this game, and over time we have lost many of the yellow program cards that are essential to the game. This app has the entire library of yellow program cards available at the touch of a finger. The app will give you your current score in the game (the number of program cards that you have completed) and allow you to clearly see your card no matter the device that you are running the app on. Equipped with fun sound effects and vibrant colours and cards created my me, you are sure to have a blast with this new twist on an old classic.
